# What it this website ?

Basically, it's the documentation of my homelab (which is mostly cloud-based, using [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com) because I'm cheap and it works and it's EU-based). 

# How does this works ?

This website is created with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), using the [Hugo Book](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-book/) theme. The code for this site is available on [Github](https://github.com/papypom/docs.kntc.be). It's hosted on a Debian VPS, which runs [CloudPanel](https://www.cloudpanel.io/). [Rclone](https://rclone.org/) is used to publish the site.

# What is covered ?

A bit of everything, the idea is to have a place where I can quickly copy-paste and remember what I did. Some stuff is still missing, including NextCloud setup, SeaweedFS experiments, Rclone setups, Cloudpanel, Debian, Postfix ... Expect updates.

# What do I need to use the information here ?

A working knowledge of Debian, some docker & docker compose understanding, basic networking, the ability to edit DNS records.
